Object Model Framework
Overview
The Object Model Framework is a Python-based program designed to facilitate the creation, management, and visualization of a network of user-defined classes. The framework allows users to define classes and establish relationships between objects, providing a versatile foundation for various applications.

Key Features
Dynamic Object Creation:

Users can create classes and instances of those classes, dynamically defining their properties and relationships.
Objects can be instantiated using data retrieved from an external system, such as a database, through APIs or other external interfaces.
External System Integration:

The framework supports seamless integration with external systems, enabling the retrieval of object properties and the creation/deletion of objects through external commands.
Users can specify the methods for communicating with external systems, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
Graph Representation:

Objects and their relationships can be visualized as a graph.
Three types of relationships are supported:
Owner: Objects owned by a particular entity are clustered together.
Link: Arrows represent connections between objects.
List: Objects with this relationship are displayed in a list within the owner's cluster.
Usage
Class Creation:

Users can define classes with specific attributes and methods.
Relationships between classes are established to reflect ownership, connections, or listing.
External Interaction:

Users can interact with external systems to fetch data, create objects, or delete objects.
API calls, database queries, or other communication methods can be implemented as needed.
Graph Visualization:

The framework provides tools to generate visual representations of the object graph, highlighting relationships based on the specified types.
